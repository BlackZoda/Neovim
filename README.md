# Neovim Config

My Neovim (Lazyvim) config based on [devalife's setup](https://www.devas.life/effective-neovim-setup-for-web-development-towards-2024/) integrated with some of plugins and keybindings from [ThePrimagen's setup](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua), and a few personal tweaks I've been using for a while.
